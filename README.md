# 🌌 Fabled Galaxy

**Fabled Galaxy** is a collaborative world-building platform connected to Discord that guides creators through designing their own planets, civilizations, technologies, magic systems, and mythologies. It is a living galaxy of user-created fables — part creative writing tool, part social storytelling universe.

The goal is to make worldbuilding **approachable, interactive, and communal**, while still respecting creator ownership and creative boundaries.

---

## ✨ Core Concept

Fabled Galaxy invites users to:

- 🌍 Create their own planet  
- 👥 Define people and cultures  
- ⚙️ Describe technology and magic systems  
- 📜 Shape myths, histories, and conflicts  
- 🌌 Share their world publicly in a Galaxy Gallery  
- 🤝 Optionally allow others to co-create within their universe  

Each planet becomes a visible “node” in a shared galaxy map, representing a unique fable created by a real person.
